* ideaDate is a web application for developers and designers to present their ideas and/or collaborate with others.
* Building off of a 'Tinder-esque' swipe-card model, we wanted to build a platform that encourages the collaborative and open-source spirit of hackathons.
* I was tasked with setting up the frontend and linking up our project and user creation pages with our API.
